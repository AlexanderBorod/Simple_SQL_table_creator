# Simple_SQL_table_creator

Easily generate code, create and populate an SQL table that resides in Excel.

When learning SQL, sometimes you are asked to load into the database a training table (create and then add values), which is presented in Excel.
 
Sometimes this can take a long time.
But when you study Python, the idea comes to make your task easier and write code that will automatically create the code for creating the table and filling it.

And if necessary, it can then be corrected manually.

To work with the program you will need:
1. Run exe file
2. specify the path to the Excel table
3. Specify the name of the sheet where the table lies
4. Make sure that the requirements specified in "!?" match.
5. Create a table
